<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About this project
## My goals
By working in various startups and small development teams, I realized that these teams often lack the minimum tools
to improve the quality and security of their developments. The desire to do better is very real,
and only time and knowledge are holding them back.

## What we will build (in green)

## Features
In this repository, I propose an approach to quickly set up and use a software factory built on open source tools.
The proposed architecture is very simple but not ready for production. It will allow you to analyze
and improve code very quickly. I use this architecture to conduct my own code audits.
This allows me to very quickly identify areas in the code where I will spend time digging and understanding.

This software factory is therefore built on:
- Gitlab Runner to orchestrate the CI pipeline,
- a step to search for secrets in the code (Gitlab secrets detection),
- a step to search for security vulnerabilities in imported dependencies (Gitlab dependency scanning),
- a step to do code quality analysis (Sonarqube), 
- a step to do static code security analysis (Gitlab SAST),
- a step to scan your images (Gitlab container scan),
- a step to create a SBOM of your project (Cyclon DX),
- and finally, a step that allows you to obtain a complete analysis report (DefectDojo).

## Prerequisites
This software factory is built on four Ubuntu 20.04 server-type OS.

I'm installing my software factory on LattePanda Alpha 864 cards. I'm providing the configuration of each VM
for reference only, which is sufficient for my code audits.

Of course, if you want a production installation, you'll need to verify this configuration.

Docker installation is mandatory on Gitlab-ce and DefectDojo virtual machines; you can check this in
the Ubuntu installation software list.

```

### First machine for Gitlab
The first machine contains:
- Gitlab-ce to load the code to be analyzed,
- Gitlab Runner to use pipelines to orchestrate code analysis,
- Gitlab secret detection,
- Gitlab dependency scanning for analyzing imported dependencies,
- Gitlab SAST for static code security analysis,
- Gitlab container scan to scan your images.

### Second machine for Sonarqube
The second machine contains:
- Sonarqube for code quality and security analysis.

### Third machine for DefectDojo
The third machine contains:
- DefectDojo, the tool that will enable DevSecOps analysis of your projects.

### Fourth machine for Nexus:
The fourth machine contains:
- The Nexus repository where we will store the builds from the CI chain.

Everything is orchestrated by pipelines in Gitlab.

<!-- SOFTWARE FACTORY INSTALLATION -->
## Create the virtual machines we need
Use your favorite virtualization tool to create these three machines. This documentation is intended
for Ubuntu OS version 20.04 LTS.

## Gitlab CE & Runner installation
### Use the following script and commands on the first VM
```shell
wget -O ~/gitlab-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntoineMeheut/ossf/refs/heads/main/install-gitlab-ce/gitlab-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

```shell
sudo bash ~/gitlab-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh -d gitlab.ame.tech
```
## Sonarqube installation
### Use the following script and commands on the second VM
```shell
wget -O ~/sonarqube-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntoineMeheut/ossf/refs/heads/main/install-sonarqube/sonarqube-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

```shell
sudo bash ~/sonarqube-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

## DefectDojo installation
### Use the following script and commands on the third VM
```shell
wget -O ~/defectdojo-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntoineMeheut/ossf/refs/heads/main/install-defectdojo/defectdojo-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

```shell
sudo bash ~/defectdojo-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

## Nexus installation
### Choose your Nexus version in the script by changing
```shell
download_url="https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.80.0-06-linux-aarch_64.tar.gz"
downloaded_file="nexus-3.80.0-06-linux-aarch_64.tar.gz"
nexus_version="nexus-3.80.0-06"
sonatype_work="sonatype-work"
```

### Use the following script and commands on the third VM
```shell
wget -O ~/nexus-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntoineMeheut/ossf/refs/heads/main/install-nexus/nexus-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

```shell
sudo bash ~/nexus-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

## Upload a project to your Gitlab
Once you have both your servers installed and have verified that you can access the URLs of your Gitlab and Sonarqube instances, upload one or two projects to your Gitlab.
# TODO

## Prepare your Gitlab CI
Use one of the Gitlab CI templates in this directory or upload your own.
