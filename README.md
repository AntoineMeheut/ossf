<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About this project
## My goals
By working in various startups and small development teams, I realized that these teams often lack the minimum tools to improve the quality and security of their developments. The desire to do better is very real, and only time and knowledge are holding them back.

## Features
In this repository, I propose an approach to quickly set up and use a software factory built on open source tools. The proposed architecture is very simple and not ready for production. But it will allow you to analyze and improve code very quickly. I use this architecture to conduct my own code audits. This allows me to very quickly identify areas in the code where I will spend time digging and understanding.

This software factory is therefore built on:
- a secrets search tool,
- a tool for searching for security vulnerabilities in imported dependencies,
- a static code security analysis tool,
- a code quality analysis tool,
- and finally, a mechanism that allows you to obtain a complete analysis report in PDF format.

## Prerequisites
This software factory is built on two virtual machines with an Ubuntu 22.04 server-type OS.

The first machine contains:
- Gitlab-ce to load the code to be analyzed,
- Gitlab Runner to use pipelines to orchestrate code analysis,
- Owasp dependency check for analyzing imported dependencies,
- and Horusec for static code security analysis.

The second machine contains:
- Sonarqube for code quality and security analysis.

Everything is orchestrated by pipelines in Gitlab.

<!-- SOFTWARE FACTORY INSTALLATION -->
## Gitlab CE & Runner installation
### Use the following script and commands
```shell
wget -O ~/gitlab-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntoineMeheut/ossf/refs/heads/main/install-gitlab-ce/gitlab-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh
```

```shell
sudo bash ~/gitlab-ubuntu-server-20.04.sh -d gitlab.ame.tech
```
## Sonarqube installation
### Use the following script and commands
```shell
#TODO
```

```shell

```
